Now I have merged my branches. Stepping in Phase 4. I feel nervous though, like something feels off about this whole project...
I don't trust stairs. They're always up to something.(me studying,2 in the morning)
Phase4 is not on Taklif_Bransh! I'm so relieved! It could be one of those momnets when something goes wrong and leaves you poker faced, staring at the screen and whispering: 'well,that shouldn't have happened.'
